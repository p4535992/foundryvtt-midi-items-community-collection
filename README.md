# Midi Items Community Collection

A compendium pack for items, feats etc configured for use with Dynamic Active Effects (DAE) as well as Midi QOL.

This project was born as an opensource reference of what it is possible to do with MidiQOL, DAE and foundryvtt with the javascript programming language.

The project is dedicated exclusively to the Dnd5e game system.

The project aims to provide users with examples of javascript code that they can use for their own adventures.

**The content is intended to be related only to SRD material and homebrew material created in a personal context, but to avoid licensing issues with non-SRD licensed Wizard of the coast products the module will not be made public.**
